# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

git merge --allow-unrelated-histories myfunnybranch

1- update main branch with remote
2- create your branch from main
3- make your changes and commits
4- push your branch to remote server (git push origin featue1)
5- create a pull request from your branch to main
6- merge the pull request if there are no conflicts

for new branch and new work do it again from step 1
